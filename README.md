# module-01-challenge-css-and-html
The Module 1 challenge for the coding bootcamp

The purpose of this challange and this repo is to consider web accesibility in styling a website. Those with disabilities have a right to use the website, and accessibility ensure they are able to use assistive technology like a screen reader or braille keyboard and still experience relatively the same thing. 
Accessibility helps in search engines and thus it is also good for business. 

This repository has a unique name, code that has been cloned and edited, and also has this README file explaining what to expect.

All of the links on the website function correctly. CSS Selectors are organized and consolidated and the CSS file is commenetd on, expalining how the selectors work. 

The website is deployed live on Github Pages. It loads without errors. 

Here is the link to the live application: https://andrewbreytenbach.github.io/module-01-challenge-css-and-html/ 

Here is a screenshot of what this should look like:
