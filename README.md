CODE REFACTOR PROJECT

## About The Project

This project was to refactor code in order to clean it up and make it more readily accessible to the users who will be interactng with the website. The HTML and CSS files were very unorganized and need to be fixed using proper semantic rules and guidelines for accessibility. 

### Built With

* HTML 
* CSS

## Getting Started

In order to acess this website, just visit the following webpage: [https://andrewbreytenbach.github.io/code-refactor-project] (Horiseon Marketing Agency)

To get a local copy up and running, simply view the index.html file or the style.css file and see how you can play around, copy, and edit the fle for personal usage. 

This code was refactored and cleaned to make it more accessible for others using the website. 

## Usage

This is an example of how to refactor or clone code and then clean it up to make the website accessible to the users who would be unable to see the website as originally designed, i.e. those using screen readers or needing some sort of visual assistance. The code was very messy originally and it needed to be simplified in order to follow best oractice for semantic structure and code organization.

Additionally, if the user wants to see how specifcially the css works to design and structure the webpage, then I have commented the entire CSS file in order to make it easy to understand and to follow how each selector functions and the purpose they serve.
